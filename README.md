## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser

## Notes

- This project uses a CORS proxy to bypass Cross-Origin issues when fetching data from Leetcode API.  
- The app requires a valid Leetcode username to fetch stats.  
- Sometimes, the proxy service may be slow or unavailable.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add error handling for invalid usernames or network failures  
- Improve UI/UX and make it mobile-friendly  
- Cache API responses for faster repeated searches
